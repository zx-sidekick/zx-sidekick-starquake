  Use whenever a ticket needs its spec or plan: "let's design X", "spec out
  #NN", "pick up #NN" when #NN has no approved plan yet, or a ticket sitting in
  `Spec` or `Plan` on the board. Runs the design-first workflow: the spec and
  plan are written IN the GitHub issue (spec template), decisions are settled
  with the maintainer there through a copy-paste answer block, and building
  only starts after the maintainer's explicit OK. Trigger even if the user
  doesn't say "skill".
---

You design a change **in its GitHub issue**: the issue is the single design
record, and the maintainer may never read chat. The one rule that matters
most: **never auto-proceed from plan to implementation.** The maintainer's OK
(the card dragged to `Build`, or a `go` / `approved` comment) is the build
signal, and it must be explicit.

Move the card at each pause with `.claude/scripts/board.sh state <n> "<state>"`.
`Spec` and `Plan` are yours; `Your input` and `Your sign-off` are the
maintainer's.

## Step 1: the issue

- **First, choose the route.** A card in `Spec` means "your call, go", not
  "write a spec": decide how much process it needs, and say so on the ticket
  with the reason (starquake-recompiled#26).
  - **A bug or tweak** small enough to need no plan: comment *"Routing: straight
    to Build — …"*, move it to `Build`, and hand it to `build-slice`. No spec.
  - **No design question left, but work that wants a plan**: move it to
    `Plan` and write the plan (#27). No spec.
  - **A small decision**: a short spec with its answer block; the plan is a few
    lines in the same body once it's answered.
  - **A feature**: the full route below.

  The maintainer overrides by dragging the card back.
- **No issue yet?** Create one from `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/spec.md`. Read that
  file and fill its sections; `gh issue create --body-file` bypasses templates
  entirely, so nothing fails when the structure goes missing. The body's first
  line is the attribution header:
  `> 🤖 **Issue by Claude** (AI pair-programmer working with @starquake) — posted through @starquake's account.`
- **A sub-issue** (filed under a parent, or split out of one) names its parent
  as `Part of #NN` and never with `Closes`, `Fixes` or `Resolves`; nor does
  its plan ask its PR to close the parent. A parent's own plan, while any
  sub-issue is open, ends in `Part of #NN` too: starquake-recompiled#76 closed its #1
  with four guidance levels still open (starquake-recompiled#84).
- **The issue exists but is free-form?** Restructure its body into the
  template's sections, keeping everything true that's already there.
- **The BODY is the living spec; the COMMENTS are the history.** Opposite
  editing rules:
  - The **body** is always current: rewrite it freely. When a question is
    answered, MOVE it into *Decisions* and DELETE it from *Open questions*. A
    body that still asks a settled question is the bug.
  - The **comments** are append-only: never edit one; post a new
    `> 🤖 **Next steps**` comment each time the state changes.
- Read the code before writing: name real symbols
  (`crates/sidekick/src/rom.rs`, `rom::answer`, `Zx::run_frame`), not
  "the machine".
- Set `Spec` while you're writing it, so the board shows it's your turn.

## Step 2: the spec

- **Goal**: what ships, plus the one-line reason.
- **Decisions**: numbered, each with its why. Anything unsettled is a question
  TO the maintainer. Never decide design direction yourself.
- **Fidelity**: say whether the change can move `sk-check entry`, `rom`,
  `keys` or `facts`, or the Fuse corpus result. If it can, the ticket says why that is right
  before the work starts — a check is never adjusted to make a change pass.
  Say whether it keeps to `GOAL.md`'s hard rules (no game or ROM data, no
  translated game logic), and whether it needs the tape or ROM, which CI has
  not got.
- **Open questions end with a copy-paste answer block.** One line per
  question, the options inline, and **every line carrying a `(rec)`**:

  ~~~
  ```
  # keep your pick, delete the rest
  Q1 the notice dims: the picture only (rec) / the whole window
  Q2 the setting lives in: the tape prompt (rec) / a command-line flag
  notes =
  ```
  ~~~

  The recommendation belongs **in the block**, not in prose under it: a bare
  menu makes the maintainer reconstruct reasoning you already did. No view?
  Write `discuss (rec)` on that line: "no recommendation" is real information.
  Before posting, re-read the prose against the block: **a question missing
  from the block is effectively not asked.**

  Mirror the block in the Next-steps comment, so it can be answered from the
  thread.
- **Answers in chat are allowed; leaving them there is not.** When the
  maintainer answers conversationally, write the answers into the BODY
  (*Decisions*, dated, with a verbatim quote wherever the wording carries
  reasoning) and post a Next-steps comment saying so **before acting on
  them**, so the record survives a session that ends unexpectedly. A fix to a
  missing or wrong block is a NEW comment, never an edit.
- **Mockup**: if the change's value is how it looks, make the mockup now
  (`mockup` skill) and embed it in the *Mockup* section. Approving the
  screenshot is part of the spec OK.
- **Hand off**: posting the block moves the ticket to `Your input` in the same
  step. Nothing open? Skip straight to the plan. A card in a lane carries no
  `needs:` label; drop one if it still has it.

## Step 3: settle, then plan

Fill the plan only once the decisions are settled (#27). Set `Plan` while you
write it. A plan already
in the body, ported from another project or drafted earlier, is checked
against this repository rather than rewritten: fix what names code that isn't
here, or say in the Next-steps comment what the build will map. Tasks go in landing order, each one green commit
(`scripts/check.sh`); failing tests first where practical; the last
task updates `README.md` / `CLAUDE.md` if anything they say changed.

## Step 4: STOP

Set `Your sign-off`, post a Next-steps comment (*Next: drag the card to `Build`
or comment `go`*), and **end there**. The build belongs to `build-slice` and
starts only on the maintainer's go.
