//! Local checks against the player's own copy of the game.
//!
//! Usage: `sk-check <command> <assets-dir>`, where the folder holds
//! `starquake.tap` and, for `rom`, `48.rom`. Nothing here runs in CI, which
//! has neither.
//!
//! - `rom [frames]`: runs a real-ROM machine through the menu and into play,
//!   and at every call the game makes to one of the three ROM routines
//!   ZX Sidekick answers, compares the real routine with the answer from the
//!   same state.
//! - `entry`: boots a real ROM, types `LOAD ""`, feeds it the tape block by
//!   block, and checks that the game starts where `sidekick::starquake` says.
//! - `keys`: chooses each control method on the title screen in turn, starts
//!   a game, and checks that the joystick reaches it through the machine:
//!   every direction and fire move the picture where Blob is; that the pause
//!   key is reported and kept from the game, which goes on playing, also
//!   after the pause key was redefined; that Start or fire alone starts a
//!   game from the title screen and goes past the intro text; and that the
//!   control facts read as recorded.
//! - `facts`: checks the entry points the guidance panel follows: the menu
//!   runs first, then play, and holding A S D F G from the top of the play
//!   loop, as End this game does, reaches the game-over screens and comes
//!   back round to the menu, in every control method; and that the
//!   teleporter table holds fifteen codes in fifteen rooms and, with a ROM,
//!   that walking into each booth prints its code; and that in play the
//!   room stays a room and every room walked into is marked visited; and
//!   that every room marked as holding a missing core piece gets a wanted
//!   piece placed in it when the game enters it; and that the pieces and
//!   the core's holes are drawn from the graphics table as the core column
//!   reads it.
//! - `map [walks]`: has the game draw every room and reads the map from
//!   them, then walks Blob at random through play from many rooms and checks
//!   that he never leaves a room through an edge the map shows closed, and
//!   never gets from one part of a room to another across a wall it shows
//!   inside.
//! - `shot <frames> [out-dir]`: runs the ROM-free machine and writes a PNG of
//!   the screen every so often, to look at.
